    "description": "### What is an apprenticeship?\n\nAn apprenticeship under Codurance is a process of learning. Guided by a dedicated mentor, you will hone the skills that are absolutely essential for a software craftsman.\n\nDifferent people have different abilities. You might be new to software development, or you might already have some experience. As part of your apprenticeship, you'll learn:\n\n  * how to **craft code** that is simple, clean, maintainable and easy to reason about\n  * how to orient your **software design** around goals\n  * **confidence** in your code that comes from applying Extreme Programming practices\n  * software development **methodologies**, including Agile and Lean\n  * **paradigms** and **design patterns** we apply to our code to clarify its intent\n  * the mentality behind **Test-Driven Development** and how we test our code\n  * the full **development lifecycle**, from your first print statement to a full system living in a production environment\n  * **speaking** and **negotiating** skills, to allow you to convey your ideas about how to approach a solution\n  * **tools** and **libraries** that help us become better at our craft\n\nYou won't be doing this alone. Your mentor will take responsibility for helping you grow and pushing your boundaries. What you learn, though, is really up to you: you'll decide what you'd like to focus upon and how you'd like to approach it.\n\n### How long is an apprenticeship, and what happens afterwards?\n\nAn apprenticeship is flexible; we expect it to take somewhere between three and six months, but depending on experience, it can be longer or shorter. The duration doesn't matter to us, as long as you're learning. Once we're happy that you can work with our customers to the standard set by our existing craftsmen, you'll be offered a brand new contract as a craftsman at Codurance.\n\n### What are you looking for in an apprentice?\n\nWe abide by a set of values, and are looking for apprentices who understand why. You don't need to have to have worked professionally. We want people who have:\n\n  * the willingness to learn\n  * an openness to new ideas\n  * passion for technology and code\n  * curiosity when encountering new concepts and tools\n  * a flexible approach\n  * the desire to create things of the highest quality\n\n### I want to apply. What do I need to do?\n\nIf you think Codurance is for you, drop us a line at **[hello@codurance.com](mailto:hello@codurance.com)** and tell us your story. If you're stuck for things to talk about, we have some suggestions:\n\n  * How passionate are you about software?\n  * With which technologies are you comfortable?\n  * Which technologies are you currently learning?\n  * Which technologies would you like to learn?\n  * Do you have any favourite technical books / blogs?\n  * Do you participate in any technical communities?\n  * Are there any pet projects you are working on? Tell us about them. And relax; we promise not to steal your ideas and won't tell anyone.\n\nWe also want links. If you're up for sharing any of the following, send them along. If you don't have them, that's not a problem; we value people, not text.\n\n  * any blog posts or articles you've written\n  * your Twitter account\n  * any open-source projects you've worked on\n  * any pet projects you're particularly proud of\n  * links to any applications you've worked on that are publicly available\n  * anything else that can help us know more about you\n\nThen just sit back and relax. We'll be in touch.",

He’ll always have the teams back\r\n*You are exposed to the entire product development process, allowing you to develop skills outside of software development\r\n*We have challenging scalability and are growing everyday. Currently there are around 3 million visitors a month on average to the website - having grown from 2 million in the last 6 months!\r\n*There’s lots to do; we are building tonnes of new features all the time and still defining what carwow is as a product\r\n*Every Friday, the engineering team is given the freedom to take a break from the backlog and work on something of interest that contributes to the technical maturity and stability of our codebase.\r\n\r\nYou should apply if:\r\n\r\n*You can demonstrate a good understanding of web technologies\r\n*You understand why testing software is useful, and try to write well-tested code as much as possible\r\n*You enjoy challenges across the entire stack\r\n*You have academic, personal or professional experience, with a dynamic web-based programming language (e.g. Ruby, Python, or PHP)\r\n*You care about software excellence\r\n*You are pragmatic in your approach to writing software (e.g. you take context into consideration, and don’t follow rules blindly)\r\n*You want to learn about software best practices such as refactoring, clean code, domain driven design, etc\r\n\r\nOur setup?\r\n\r\nOur product teams are cross functional and typically consist of full stack developers, designers, PMs, and insight analysts\r\nThe teams are focussed around reaching core objectives for the year. Some of our objectives for this year include: launching a leasing proposition, increasing sales of in-stock cars, increasing dealership groups engagement.\r\n\r\nWe love Ruby, JavaScript, Git, TDD, and OSS and use a bunch of other technologies daily; Haml, Sass, Heroku, AWS being the most usual suspects\r\n\r\nAbout carwow\r\n\r\ncarwow is the most convenient, stress-free way to find and buy a new car, at a price you can be confident in. carwow aims to solve the major pain points that buyers and dealers experience in the buying process, putting them in a more powerful position than ever before. Offering buyers crucial price confidence, a more convenient hassle free way to find and buy the car they want, and an altogether better buying experience. And it's great news for dealers too. Through carwow, our dealer partners sell more cars than they could in the showroom alone, while reducing cost inefficiencies and increasing stock turnover. This means they can pass on great prices to carwow buyers.\r\n\r\nWe’re a driven, energetic startup with a team of 140+ based in central London and Munich. We are backed by Europe’s leading VCs including:\r\n\r\n- Balderton Capital (Betfair, LOVEFiLM, Citymapper, MySQL)\r\n\r\n- Accel (Facebook, Spotify, Dropbox, Groupon)\r\n\r\n- Vitruvian Partners (JustEat, Skyscanner, Trustpilot)\r\n\r\n- Episode 1 (Zoopla, Shazam, LOVEFiLM)\r\n\r\n- Samos (Ocado, Betfair, PKR)\r\n\r\nWe’ve raised over £48m in funding since we launched, so we’re growing fast. We’re relentlessly driven and constantly asking ourselves how we can make carwow better.",
