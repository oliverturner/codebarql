Supported by introductory programming workshops, community members not currently working in technology are also encouraged to participate.</p><p>The install and networking social will takes place on <strong>Friday March 27</strong>, followed by the main workshop and hackday on <strong>Saturday, 28 March</strong>.</p><h5>Why?</h5><p> Naomi explains: “As technology offers growing opportunities, being sure these opportunities are equally accessible to traditionally marginalised groups grows ever more important. Participants can come from any background, working together to create prototypes around the themes of transgender issues and access to technology.\nThere is a small budget to help support some attendees with travel and lodging, so if you have an idea, can code, can design, want to learn, or want to improve the situation\nof the trans and non­binary communities through technology, please join us and help make history.”</p>\n<p>The event is organised by <a href='http://trans-code.org' target='_blank'>Trans*Code</a></p>.\n",

      "As a web developer, it's important to have your own website. Blogging about your learnings and having a portfolio of work not only gives you a nice record of what you've achieved, it also shows potential employers what you know.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, we will use a content and mobile first approach to build a web page that you can take away and use to enhance your own web presence. You can choose between a portfolio page and a blog page (examples will be provided). \r\n\r\nWe will begin by adding the content and writing HTML. Then we will move onto CSS. We will also build our own grid system for the layout and add media queries for each component, making sure they are tested in different screen sizes.\r\nSome knowledge of HTML and CSS is required and beginners are welcome.\r\n\r\nStudents and coaches can sign up for free tickets here: https://ti.to/clearleft/build-your-own-portfolio-website",

Or, at all, really. In order for this day to be successful, we're counting on YOU to make some amazing sessions happen. This is a 100% participant-driven event: we're going to suggest times and spaces, and in the morning, you'll pitch sessions and snag slots on the schedule.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What kinds of sessions should I prepare?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, we're all here because we have a passion for software development, mentoring, and community. It would be awesome to have sessions related to any of those -- last year, we had an introduction to D3.js, a workshop on Arduinos, a demo on making music with functional programming, an interactive retrospectives discussion, and many more. But, if you really want to pitch a session on something else entirely, you're more than welcome to. This event is what we make of it -- the org team will just be present to make sure you're engaged, entertained, and well-fed and well-watered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is first and foremost a celebration of the efforts of the codebar coaches who have donated countless hours of mentorship over the years. We're opening it up to codebar students and friends as well, but we're asking for a suggested donation of £10 (minimum £5) so we cover our costs for the day. We're also doing this to minimise no-shows -- it really sucks when people don't turn up to events when there were others who would've wanted that spot. If this is prohibitive for you, please get in touch with us at london@codebar.io and we'll see what we can do.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PS </strong> - Please <a href=\"https://codebar-slack.herokuapp.com\">join us</a> on <a href=\"https://codebar.slack.com\">our Slack channel</a> for uncodebar-related discussion!</p>",

      "<p style=\"font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: 500\">Join us for a special Saturday workshop in Brighton introducing you to Android mobile app development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this workshop you will work through set of tutorials which will introduce you to Android app development. These are suitable for students who have done even a small amount with a programming language like Javascript, Ruby, or Python. If you have done Javascript lesson 2 then you will be fine!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This will be a great workshop for students who are becoming comfortable with coding, but want to see what possibilities there are beyond building websites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We ask that all students run through the setup process for Android Studio on their laptop before attending the event by following <a href=\"https://codebar.github.io/android-tutorials/\">this guide</a>.</strong> This is because it is a fairly large download and if you wait until the event it will take you awhile to get set up and could cause problems with the internet for others. If you get stuck with the setup, get as far as you can and a coach will be happy to help on the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are also looking for coaches with Android development experience. If you're on Slack (or want to join), send a message to @matt or email him on <a href=\"mailto:hello@mattoakes.net\">hello@mattoakes.net</a> for more information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>If you've any dietary requirements please email us at <a href=\"mailto:brighton@codebar.io\">brighton@codebar.io</a> as lunch and snacks will be provided.</strong></p>",

The day will start with focussed lessons designed to teach you the fundamentals of programming and in the afternoon you will have the opportunity to create your own program and show us what you've done. \r\n\r\nWhether it be rock, paper, scissors, a banana keyboard or a milk carton robot, there's an endless possibility of fun projects with the BBC  micro:bit, and we cannot wait to get playing with them!

      "<p class=\"lead\">uncodebar, the codebar unconference is back! Now in it's third year, uncodebar is our one day event that encourages codebar coaches to come together, share knowledge, and strengthen the community that supports our workshops.</p>\r\n<h4>What is this?</h4>\r\n<p>uncodebar is an <strong>unconference</strong>, a loosely structured open space type event emphasizing the informal exchange of information and ideas between participants. We're not putting out a Call For Papers or planning any of the content in advance. In order for this day to be successful, we're counting on YOU to make some amazing sessions happen. This is a 100% participant-driven event: we're going to suggest times and spaces, and in the morning, you'll pitch sessions and snag slots on the schedule.</p>\r\n<h4>What kinds of sessions should I prepare?</h4>\r\n<p>As this is an unconference, you can decide what type of session you want to run: workshops, talks, discussions, etc are all welcome. Topics can include anything related to web development, software development, game development, learning, mentoring, community, and many more. It would be awesome to have sessions related to any of those -- last year we had sessions ranging from an ‘Intro to Elm’ to ‘Typography for Developers’. We talked about ‘Building Inclusive Teams’ and ‘Apprenticeships and Software Craftsmanship’. We got an ‘Intro to Docker’ and saw a demonstration on how to build ‘IOT Puzzle Gadgets using LISP’. But, if you really want to pitch a session on something else entirely, you're more than welcome to. This event is what we make of it -- the organisers will just be present to make sure you're engaged, entertained, well-fed and well-watered.</p>\r\n<p>This event is primarily aimed at our coaches but students are welcome as well. We would especially like to see sessions from students. If you have an idea for a session but need help developing it, feel free to get in touch with any of the codebar organisers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"lead\">All attendees are welcome to join the #uncodebar channel in the <a href=\"http://codebar-slack.herokuapp.com/\">codebar Slack</a> to discuss potential sessions and session ideas.</p>",
