While it was interesting to go through the process of trying to google the result together, it meant that we just didn't make a lot of progress for a really long time. I eventually suggested we ask another coach for help which we did although the other coach didn't really get what the problem was. Eventually my coach thought of a workaround so we could move on, but it didn't really solve the underlying problem and I felt like it would have been better to soak up some of the knowledge in the room somehow rather than just search for answers online like I could have done by myself at home. Some googling is fine obviously (and definitely a useful skill to learn), but when it goes on and on it just doesn't seem like the best use of my/their time. While I wouldn't want to disrupt others' lessons I don't think most people would mind, and if you happen upon a coach whose area of speciality that is, they can probably solve the problem in about two seconds. So maybe my suggestion is to let coaches know that they are allowed to ask other coaches for help. (Some coaches do this already, and I have found I've enjoyed those sessions more).",

Could you in such an unfortunate event at least stop late-coming students from randomly storming into a group? \r\nPossibly a few more guidelines on how to teach a group could help improving the quality of the class so that less people are left with frustration.\r\nOn top of the challenging behavioral issues in the beginner's group I was in, the event hall looked lovely but had terrible acoustics.

Having already attempted the tutorial beforehand helped me to identify more specific questions, which of course Jack clarified with hesitation. My learning was really cranked up a notch by this workshop. ",

You know that there has been an increasing demand for Rails coaching this month.\r\nYesterday,I was paired with Jacqueline to work with James.\r\nAlthough very kind and polite, I felt the coach was more inclined to give more time to the other student. From the outset, he told me he won't be available for the next 30 minutes as he helped the other student. Jacqueline had specificly approached Kimberley during registration perhaps to secure her preference with a specific coach-but I might be wrong?. I went around to see if I could join other Rails group but there were already 3 students there. After all we were only two students assigned to a coach. I stood my ground and asked to be helped on a fairer ground and suggested a 10 minutes rota between each student, unless I have been too demanding/or my request was insensible. Another thing,  I tought it wasn't really part of the code of ethics to communicate with coach outside workshop events, but there again I may be wrong?\r\nIn the end my rails app was fixed so I am grateful but I had to request attention. I felt slightly uncomfortable with underlining favoritism .\r\nThe venue was great thanks for organising!",

Also - just wondering if there is any nice way to match coaches in terms of their specialism - I know it is a bit tricky as they are volunteers but I think the coach we had hadn't done ruby for a while so wasn't up to speed with the latest stuff. Also wondering if there is any option for a couple of people to do quick 5 min talks at the start of the session whilst everyone is getting some food to talk about what they do or about projects they are working on and what skills they have as always interested in hearing about what people are up to.

      "I don't want to name names (it's not GIUSEPPE! because it feels mean and I think it's not something done on purpose) BUT I think it might be a good idea to help the coaches get to know how to teach?\r\n\r\nCodebar is fantastic and I've been coming since the early days. It's great that it has expanded so much but that also means that perhaps coaches  and students end up a bit less supported. I found that my experience of codebar really depends on the soft-skills of the coach. \r\n\r\nTeaching is not an easy thing, and having worked in the tech industry, I think that the 'soft skills' are very different from being a teacher. It's basically about making your student feel as comfortable as possible, reassuring them that there are 'no stupid questions' etc. I used to be a teacher, and it took a long time to get out the 'I feel awkward' phase to the 'ok, my job is to make students feel as comfortable as possible so that they are in a safe space to make mistakes and learn'. I think that is a totally different environment to the traditional office where you have to transmit information is the most efficient way possible.\r\n\r\nI think that a short pdf/reminder document/coaches page could be really helpful. e.g:\r\n\r\nTeaching skills\r\n\r\nPlease spend a few minutes getting to know your student\r\nAsk them how they found codebar\r\nWhat do they hope to do with their new coding skills in future\r\nIf they struggle with anything in particular with coding\r\nWhat their day job is/if they are studying.\r\nReassure them that there are no silly questions!\r\n\r\nRemember to spend equal amounts of time interacting with both students. (I know it can be tricky!) But it is your responsibility to check in with them how they are - they should not have to interrupt you.\r\n\r\nIf they ask a difficult question you can just smile and laugh, you don't have to be an expert on everything.\r\n\r\nRemember that a student can be sensitive, please make sure your student feels welcome at all times. They need patience and reassurance!\r\n\r\n\r\nIt also might be worth holding a 'teaching skills' workshop. But obviously there'd be lots of work involved in that! Anyway, just an idea. \r\n\r\nKeep up the good work codebar!!!!!!!",

He asked if he could sit along side and ask Andy a few questions here and there which would have been fine. We said no problem at all. However it actually ended up that we didn't really have a coach and he spent all of his time with the other student which wasn't ideal. We didn't really progress this week at all which was a shame.

I decided that I would keep the final section to work on my own. I told him he could guide me through the beginning of javascript since I was planning to start that shortly. Once again I just think he wasn't sure what he should be doing? He wasn't really giving me time to process and he was saying it didn't seem like I was really enjoying learning, but really it is just that he wasn't giving me the time to try and learn. I think maybe he might have been nervous or maybe that is just how he is, but I didn't feel very comfortable learning with him. I normally love going and the coaches are very helpful and encouraging.

Going through the tutorial with us step by step, not just reading through it with us but explaining as we went. Really felt worthwhile, sitting there with someone, and not only going through the material alone.\r\nI think he's a really fantastic teacher. He pays attention to the material from a student perspective - what might not be intuitive to us, what needs further explanation, so I found that I had loads of questions. It felt a bit like pair programming, from what I understand of what that looks like. He's really encouraging of experimentation beyond the bounds of the tutorial. Couldn't give him high enough praise.\r\nTo be honest, I might also have had loads of questions because the tutorial itself throws up more questions than it explicitly answers for a student e.g. how floats work, when and why you would change certain properties. Definitely a good tutorial to encourage you to use google to figure things out though, since that's what we did a lot.\r\nAlso, just want to say again, I really love codebar's set up of having a short time at the beginning to socialise and then going to the pub after the coding session.

Rather than first grouping people who were working on similar projects, the host seemed be mainly going down the list of attendees and finding coaches to work with that specific person. By the end of it there had to be some reshuffling to spread the coaches out. Also, I'm not sure how much information the organisers have on the coaches, but I feel like there could be a bit more research done beforehand to find out which coaches are able to cover which languages (and what their preferences are). Coaches and students could be mostly sorted whilst everyone is eating, rather than asking coaches to raise their hand to volunteer for specific languages during the pairing part of the evening. On a completely separate note, it would also be helpful if I was able to resize this feedback box in the browser to save me from scrolling in a tiny box, as I can only see 2 lines of my feedback at a time.",

Derek did such a fantastic job of explaining possible sorting algorithms we could choose from and how they worked--why they would be faster--and then we worked on implementing one of the possible solutions.
